Experience the ground-shaking violence as 720 cubic miles of molten rock exploded into the stratosphere, creating a volcanic winter that lasted a decade and forged the genetic bottleneck that makes every human alive today a descendant of those who refused to surrender to the earth's fury.",

      "description": "Journey to 700 million years ago when Earth transformed into a frozen sphere, wrapped in ice from pole to pole for 50 million years in the most extreme climate event in planetary history. Experience the eerie beauty of a world where purple bacterial seas lurk beneath miles of ice, where life retreats to hydrothermal vents and frozen dormancy, and where the patient accumulation of volcanic carbon dioxide finally triggers the most dramatic thaw in Earth's memory.",

      "description": "Travel to 485 million years ago to witness the birth of the Appalachian Mountains as the Taconic collision slowly grinds ancient seafloors into towering peaks. Feel the patient power of continental drift as the Iapetus Ocean closes and Taconia collides with Laurentia, transforming trilobite-rich limestone into the schists and granites of mountain cores. This is the story of how Earth's greatest construction projects unfold over millions of years, creating the pillars of stone that would support countless future ecosystems.",
