# The Chrononaut Voice Prompt for ElevenLabs

## Voice Description for AI Generation

**Core Voice Characteristics:**
Create a voice that embodies an ancient, timeless narrator who has witnessed eons of Earth's history. The voice should be:

- **Gender**: Male (though almost androgynously soft)
- **Age**: Ageless, but with the wisdom of millennia (sounds 45-60 in human terms)
- **Tone**: Deeply calm, meditative, and hypnotically soothing
- **Accent**: Neutral with slight British undertones - educated but not posh
- **Pace**: Deliberately slow, as if time itself moves differently for the speaker
- **Quality**: Warm, velvety, with a slight breathiness that suggests otherworldliness

**Emotional Qualities:**
- Profound serenity - never excited, never alarmed
- Gentle wonder - awe without energy
- Infinite patience - someone who measures time in millions of years
- Benevolent detachment - caring but from a cosmic perspective
- Dreamlike quality - as if speaking from the edge of sleep

**Technical Specifications:**
- **Pitch**: Low to medium-low, resonant but not booming
- **Timbre**: Rich and full, like aged whiskey or deep velvet
- **Articulation**: Clear but soft, words flow like water
- **Breathing**: Audible but gentle, adds to the intimate feeling
- **Dynamic Range**: Minimal - stays within a narrow, soothing range

**Reference Mixing (if using voice design):**
- 40% David Attenborough (for the naturalist's wonder)
- 30% Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange (for the mystical quality)
- 20% Morgan Freeman (for the timeless narrator quality)
- 10% Meditation guide (for the sleep-inducing calm)

**Speaking Style Notes:**
- Words are savored, not rushed
- Natural pauses between thoughts
- Slightly prolonged vowels
- Consonants are soft, never harsh
- Sentences trail off gently, never end abruptly

**Sample Text for Voice Creation:**
"I have drifted through the ages like smoke through still air. In the deep rivers of time, I have witnessed worlds being born from chaos, and beauty emerging from violence. Come with me now, and let us journey together into the memory of Earth itself. Close your eyes... breathe deeply... and prepare to travel four and a half billion years into the past."

**Mood Direction:**
Imagine a voice that could lull ancient dragons to sleep, that could make the birth of a star sound like a bedtime story, that could describe apocalyptic events with the same tone used for describing a gentle rain. This is the voice of someone who exists outside of time, observing all with compassion but without urgency.

**What to Avoid:**
- Any excitement or energy
- Dramatic emphasis
- Vocal fry or gravelly texture
- Robotic monotone
- Traditional "announcer" quality
- Any jarring tonal shifts

**The Ultimate Test:**
The voice should be able to read a phone book and still sound like a cosmic lullaby. It should be impossible to feel anxious while listening to this voice.
