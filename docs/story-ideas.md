## Story Generation Guidelines for Extended Format

### Pacing for 1.5-2 Hour Content:
- Approximately 12,000-16,000 words per story
- 6-8 major "chapters" or movements
- Multiple perspective shifts within same event
- Revisit locations at different times
- Include "breathing spaces" - extended sensory moments
- Layer in multiple narrative threads

### Maintaining Engagement:
- Vary sensory focus between chapters
- Include "mini-journeys" within the larger narrative
- Use recurring motifs and callbacks
- Gradually deepen rather than rush through events
- Multiple climaxes and resolutions
- Gentle cliffhangers between chapters (resolved peacefully)

### Sleep-Optimized Structure:
- Energy peaks in first third
- Gradually slower pacing through middle
- Most peaceful content in final third
- Longer pauses between chapters as story progresses
- Increasingly dreamlike language toward end
- Final 20 minutes should be the most soporific
