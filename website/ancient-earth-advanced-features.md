# Advanced Ancient Earth Features

Now that we have the GPlates proxy working, here are additional features we can implement:

## 1. Motion Paths üõ§Ô∏è
Show the complete journey of a location through time:
```javascript
// Get motion path for New York from present to 200 MYA
const motionPath = await fetch('/api/gplates/reconstruct?feature=motion_path&points=-74,40&time=200');
// Returns a LineString showing the path through time
```

## 2. Plate Boundaries üåã
Display tectonic plate boundaries for any time period:
```javascript
// Get plate boundaries for 100 MYA
const boundaries = await fetch('/api/gplates/reconstruct?feature=plate_boundaries&time=100');
// Returns LineStrings for all plate boundaries
```

## 3. Coastlines üèñÔ∏è
Get accurate coastlines instead of using static textures:
```javascript
// Get reconstructed coastlines for 150 MYA
const coastlines = await fetch('/api/gplates/reconstruct?feature=coastlines&time=150');
// Returns MultiLineString of all coastlines
```

## 4. Feature Ideas to Implement:

### Visual Enhancements
- **Motion trails**: Show colored trails following locations through time
- **Plate boundary visualization**: Different colors for different boundary types
  - Red: Divergent (spreading) boundaries
  - Blue: Convergent (collision) boundaries
  - Green: Transform boundaries
- **Hotspot tracks**: Show volcanic island chains like Hawaii
- **Speed indicators**: Color-code plates by their velocity

### Interactive Features
- **Measure tool**: Calculate distance between ancient positions
- **Multi-location tracking**: Track multiple cities simultaneously
- **Plate information**: Click on a plate to see its name and motion
- **Time-lapse comparisons**: Side-by-side view of different eras

### Educational Features
- **Supercontinent assembly**: Animated formation of Pangaea, Rodinia, etc.
- **Mass extinction markers**: Visual indicators on the timeline
- **Climate zones**: Show ancient climate belts
- **Sea level changes**: Animate rising/falling oceans

### Data Export
- **Download motion path**: Export location journey as CSV/KML
- **Share specific views**: Shareable URLs with time/location
- **Create animations**: Export as GIF or video

## Implementation Priority:
1. Motion paths (easiest, high impact)
2. Plate boundaries (moderate complexity, very visual)
3. Coastlines (complex but accurate)
4. Multi-location comparison
5. Export features

Would you like me to implement any of these features?
